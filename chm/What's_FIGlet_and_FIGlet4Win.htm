<H1>What's FIGlet and FIGlet4Win</H1>
<UL>
  <LI>
  <H3>What is FIGlet?</H3></LI></UL>
<P>FIGlet is a program for making large letters out of 
ordinary text.&nbsp;It can create characters in many different styles and can kern and "smush" these characters together in various ways.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
<H3>      Where can I get FIGlet from?</H3></LI></UL>
<P>From the official <A 
href="http://www.figlet.org/">FIGlet website</A>&nbsp;or from the <A 
href="ftp://ftp.figlet.org/pub/figlet">FIGlet FTP site</A>           .</P>

<H3>What is the difference between FIGlet and 
  FIGlet4Win?</H3></LI></UL>
<P>FIGlet is a really old project which started in 1991, 
and its last "update" was in 2015. Truly the original FIGlet is stable enough 
and doesn't need much new features any more, but it doesn't change that the 
FIGlet source code cannot be compiled under modern Windows systems (like Windows 
10), and lots of the codes are Unix-like-based.</P>
<P>FIGlet4Win is a project forked from the original FIGlet, 
to let it operate on mordern Windows systems just like it should           be.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
<H3>What has been changed in           FIGlet4Win?</H3></LI></UL>
<P>Not quite           much.</P>
<P>The only user-related change is: the default font 
directory has been set by default to the <U>fonts</U> directory under the 
FIGlet4Win install directory (was <U>/usr/local/share/figlet</U>), and relative default font 
directory will always be converted to a absolute path based on the install 
directory. That means: using a relative default font directory and make 
FIGlet4Win to read multiple default font directories under different pathes will 
not           work.</P>
<P>This is mainly because the differences of file path 
formats between Windows and Unix-like           systems.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
<H3>Can FIGlet4Win be compiled under other operating 
           systems?</H3></LI></UL>
<P>It should, but that's not the goal of FIGlet4Win. 
Therefore compatibility with other platforms is not           considered.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
<H3>Where can I get more fonts for           FIGlet?</H3></LI></UL>
<P>From the&nbsp;<A 
href="ftp://ftp.figlet.org/pub/figlet/fonts/">FTP site</A>&nbsp;or from the <A 
href="http://www.figlet.org/fontdb.cgi">FIGlet font database</A>.&nbsp;There is 
also a <A href="https://github.com/cmatsuoka/figlet-fonts">font database on 
GitHub</A>&nbsp;created by Claudio Matsuoka, a developer of the FIGlet           project.</P>
<P>There are currently over 400 fonts available for 
download, hope you will find your one and           enjoy!</P>

  <LI>
<H3>Where does the name FIGlet come           from?</H3></LI></UL>
