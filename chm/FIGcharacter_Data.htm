<H1>FIGcharacter Data</H1>
<P>The <STRONG>FIGcharacter data</STRONG> begins on the 
next line after the comments and continues to the end of the file.</P>
<H3>Basic Data Structure</H3>
<P>The <STRONG>sub-characters</STRONG> in the file are 
given exactly as they should be output, with two exceptions:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>
<DIV>Hardblanks should be the hardblank character 
  specified in the header line, not 
  a blank (space).</DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV>      
    Every line has one or two endmark characters, whose 
  column locations define the width of each 
  <STRONG>FIGcharacter</STRONG>.</DIV></LI></OL>
<P>In most <STRONG>FIGfonts</STRONG>, the endmark character 
is either "@" or "#". The <STRONG>FIGdriver</STRONG> will eliminate the last 
block of consecutive equal characters from each line of 
<STRONG>sub-characters</STRONG> when the font is read in. By convention, the 
last line of a <STRONG>FIGcharacter</STRONG> has two endmarks, while all the rest 
have one. This makes it easy to see where <STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG> begin and end.&nbsp;No
line should have more than two endmarks.</P>
<P>Below is an example of the first few 
<STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG>, taken from small.flf.</P>
<P>NOTE: The line drawn below consisting of "|" represents 
the left margin of your editor.&nbsp;It is NOT part of the 
<STRONG>FIGfont</STRONG>.&nbsp;Also note that hardblanks
are represented as "$" in this <STRONG>FIGfont</STRONG>, as would 
be described in the header line.</P>

<P>Notice that each <STRONG>FIGcharacter</STRONG> occupies 
the same number of lines (6 lines, in this case), which must also be expressed 
in the header line as the Height parameter.</P>
<P>Also notice that for every 
<STRONG>FIGcharacter</STRONG>, there must be a consistent width (length) for 
each line once the endmarks are removed.&nbsp;To do otherwise would be an 
error.</P>
<P>Be aware of the vertical alignment of each 
<STRONG>FIGcharacter</STRONG> within its height, so that all 
<STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG> will be properly lined up when printed.</P>
<P>If one of the last <STRONG>sub-characters</STRONG> in a 
particular <STRONG>FIGcharacter</STRONG> is "@", you should use another 
character for the endmark in that <STRONG>FIGcharacter</STRONG> so that the 
intended "@" is not interpreted as an endmark. "#" is a common alternative.</P>
<P>Load a few existing <STRONG>FIGfonts</STRONG> into your 
favorite text editor for other examples.</P>
<H3>Required FIGcharacters</H3>
<P>Some <STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG> 
are required, and must be represented in a specific order. Specifically: all of 
the printable character codes from ASCII shown in the table below, in order, 
plus character codes 196, 214, 220, 228, 246, 252, and 223, in that 
order.&nbsp;In Latin-1, these 
extra 7 characters represent the following German characters: umlauted "A", "O", "U", 
"a", "o" and "u"; and also "ess-zed".</P>

<P>If you do not wish to define <STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG> for all of those 
required above, you MAY create "empty" <STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG> in their 
place by placing endmarks flush with the left margin. The Deutsch 
<STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG> are commonly created as empty.&nbsp;If your 
<STRONG>FIGfont</STRONG> includes only capital letters, please copy them to the 
appropriate lowercase locations, rather than leaving lowercase letters 
empty.&nbsp;A <STRONG>FIGfont</STRONG> which does not include at least all ASCII 
letters, a space, and a few basic punctuation marks will probably frustrate some 
users.&nbsp;(For example "@" is more frequently desired as a 
<STRONG>FIGcharacter</STRONG> than you may think, since Email addresses may be 
written as <STRONG>FIGures</STRONG>.)</P>
<H3>Code Tagged FIGcharacters</H3>
<P>After the required <STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG>, you 
may create <STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG> with any character code in the range 
of -2147483648 to +2147483647. (Over four billion possibilities, which is 
"virtual infinity" for this purpose.)</P>
<P>One exception: character code -1 is NOT allowed for 
technical reasons. It is advisable to assign character codes such that the 
appearance of your <STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG> matches the expectations of 
ASCII/Latin-1/Unicode, with a few exceptions:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>
<DIV>If a <STRONG>FIGcharacter</STRONG> with code 0 is 
  present, it is treated specially.&nbsp;It is a <STRONG>FIGfont's</STRONG> 
  "missing character".&nbsp;Whenever the <STRONG>FIGdriver</STRONG> is told to 
  print a character which doesn't exist in the current <STRONG>FIGfont</STRONG>, 
  it will print <STRONG>FIGcharacter</STRONG> 0. If there is no 
  <STRONG>FIGcharacter</STRONG> 0, nothing will be printed.</DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV>  If a <STRONG>FIGfont </STRONG>contains a non-Latin 
  alphabet in character codes in the ASCII range 32-126 (which is discouraged), 
  we have found it helpful to include a human-readable translation table as one 
  of the <STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG> instead of a "glyph".&nbsp;Typically, 
  the "~" would contain this table.&nbsp;The translation table 
  <STRONG>FIGcharacter</STRONG> would 
  contain a list of all the special characters in the <STRONG>FIGfont</STRONG>, 
  along with the ASCII characters to which they correspond.&nbsp;Keep this table 
  no more than 79 columns wide. (Thanks to Gedaliah Friedenberg for this 
  idea.)</DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV>  In more extensive Unicode fonts, you can assign a 
  negative character code (other than -1) to one or more translation tables, 
  similar to #2 above.&nbsp;(All Unicode character codes are positive.) And, you 
  will most likely suggest within the comments that a user access one of several 
  <STRONG>control files</STRONG> (See <A href="Control_Files.htm">Control 
  Files</A>) to gain access to Latin-2, Latin-3, or other 8-bit standardized 
  character sets.&nbsp;The <STRONG>control files</STRONG>      
           
  may redirect the "~" character to one of the negative character codes so that 
  the translation table would display the table when "~" is given for 
  input.&nbsp;Doing this allows you to still have a "~" 
  <STRONG>FIGcharacter</STRONG> for those who do not use a control file.</DIV></LI></OL>
<P>Those <STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG> which are not 
required must have an explicit character code in a separate line preceding them, 
called a "code tag".&nbsp;A code tag contains the value of the character code, 
followed by whitespace (a few spaces), and perhaps an optional comment.&nbsp;The 
comment is usually the name of the <STRONG>FIGcharacter</STRONG>.&nbsp;The Unicode Consortium has 
assigned formal names to all officially accepted characters, and these may be 
used.&nbsp;An entire code tag, including the comment, should not occupy more 
than 95 columns.&nbsp;(Over 100 characters here may make older versions of 
<STRONG>FIGlet</STRONG> crash.)</P>
<P>Here is an example, showing two code tagged <STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG> 
after the last two required Deutsch <STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG>.&nbsp;Again, 
the line drawn below consisting of "|" represents the left margin, and is NOT 
part of the <STRONG>FIGfont</STRONG>.</P>

</TEXTAREA></P>
<P>A character code may be expressed in decimal (as shown above, numbers we're 
all familiar with), or in Octal (seldom used) or in hexadecimal.</P>
<P>Character codes expressed in octal must be preceded by "0" (zero), and if 
negative, "-" (minus) must precede the "0".&nbsp;There are eight octal digits: 
01234567.&nbsp;You may recall octal numbers from school as "base 8 numbers".</P>
<P>Character codes expressed in hexadecimal must be preceded by "0x" or "0X". 
(That's also a zero.) If negative, the "-" must precede the "0x".&nbsp;There are 
16 hexadecimal digits: 01234567890ABCDEF.&nbsp;(The "letter-digits" may also be 
lowercase.)&nbsp;Hexadecimal is "base 16".</P>
<P>It is common to express character codes less than 256 (in the range of an 
8-bit character set) as decimal, while <STRONG>FIGfonts</STRONG> which extend 
into the Unicode range would have character codes expressed in 
hexadecimal.&nbsp;This is because the Unicode Standard expresses character codes 
in hexadecimal, which is helpful for programmers.</P>
<P>The code tagged 
<STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG> may be 
listed in any order, but simple sequential order is recommended.</P>
<P>If two or more <STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG> have the same character code, 
the last one in&nbsp;the <STRONG>FIGfont</STRONG> is the one used.&nbsp;It is 
common for the Deutsch <STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG> to be given twice in a 
<STRONG>FIGfont</STRONG>, just to maintain a consistent order for the Latin-1 
range (128 to 255).</P>
<P>It is not advisable to assign character codes in the 
range of 1 to 31, since this range includes control characters in 
ASCII.&nbsp;Character code 127 is a delete in ASCII, and is also not 
advised.&nbsp;Character codes 128 to 159 are additional control characters in 
Latin-1, and they too should not be used. All of the above are legal, 
technically, but are not part of what is legal for input, so they could only be 
accessed by use of a <STRONG>control file</STRONG>. (See <A 
href="Control_Files.htm">Control Files</A>) If you 
are still tempted to use them, consider negative character codes instead, which 
are meaningless in all standardized character sets.</P>Again, the character code 
-1 is illegal for technical reasons.</body>
