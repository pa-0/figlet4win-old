<H1>Notes - Avoiding Errors and General Advice</H1>
<P>It is very important that every character in a font has 
the same height, and, once the endmarks are removed, that all the lines 
constituting a single <STRONG>FIGcharacter</STRONG> have the same 
length.&nbsp;Be careful also that no lines in the font file have trailing blanks 
(spaces), as the <STRONG>FIGdriver</STRONG> will take these to be the endmarks. 
(<STRONG>FIGWin 1.0</STRONG> will not consider blanks to be endmarks.)</P>
<P>Errors in a <STRONG>FIGfont</STRONG> can be detected by using 
the&nbsp;<STRONG>chkfont</STRONG> program, part of the standard 
<STRONG>FIGlet</STRONG> package, and also available, as of this writing from <A 
href="http://www.figlet.org/">http://www.figlet.org/</A>.</P>
<P>For <STRONG>FIGWin</STRONG> users, the <STRONG>FIGWin</STRONG> program will 
report errors when a <STRONG>FIGfont </STRONG>is read in; it is less forgiving 
than <STRONG>FIGlet</STRONG>, which can produce nonsense if the 
<STRONG>FIGfont</STRONG> is incorrectly formatted.</P>
<P>Remember that <STRONG>sub-characters</STRONG> outside of the ASCII range will 
not necessarily display the same way on your system as on others.</P>
<P>The blank (space) <STRONG>FIGcharacter</STRONG> should usually consist of one 
or two columns of hardblanks and nothing else; slanted fonts are an exception to 
this rule. If the space <STRONG>FIGcharacter</STRONG> does not contain any 
hardblanks, it will disappear when horizontal fitting (kerning) or smushing 
occurs.</P>
<P>Again, if you design a <STRONG>FIGfont</STRONG>, please let us 
know!</P></body>
