 Standardized Capabilities of Current and Future 
FIGdrivers</H1>
<P> 
 We assert the following as the "Law" of our 
intentions:</P>
<H3>Profit</H3>
<P>All future <STRONG>FIGdrivers</STRONG> shall be FREE OF 
CHARGE to the general public via the Internet.&nbsp;Any advertisements of other 
works by the author must be in documentation only, and limited to ONE 
"screenful", and shall not appear by normal program behavior, nor interfere with 
normal behavior.&nbsp;No <STRONG>FIGdriver</STRONG> shall disable itself after a 
set period of time or request "donations". No <STRONG>FIGdriver</STRONG> shall 
offer any other FIGdriver with improved capability for creating 
<STRONG>FIGures</STRONG> in exchange for money.</P>
<H3>Required Features of Future Versions</H3>
<P>Future <STRONG>FIGdrivers</STRONG> must read and process 
FIGfont files as described in this document, but are not necessarily expected to 
process <STRONG>control files</STRONG>, smush, perform fitting or kerning, 
perform vertical operations, or even produce multiple lines in output 
<STRONG>FIGures</STRONG>.</P>
<H3>FIGdriver Names</H3>
<P>Future <STRONG>FIGdrivers</STRONG> must be named to 
include capitalized "FIG" and shall have an incremental version number specific 
to its own platform.</P>
<H3>Backwards Compatibility of Future Versions</H3>
<P>Any future <STRONG>FIGdriver</STRONG> created for the 
same platform as an existing <STRONG>FIGdriver</STRONG>, and using the same name 
as the existing <STRONG>FIGdriver</STRONG>, shall be considered a new version of 
the preceding <STRONG>FIGdriver</STRONG>, and shall contain all historical 
comments of updates to past versions on the same platform, and shall have full 
capability of the preceding versions. If the source code is not provided to the 
general public, it shall be at least provided to any potential developers of 
later versions, and such comments relating to past versions shall be accessible 
to any user by other means or documentation. If a new program is created on a 
platform that already has an existing <STRONG>FIGdriver</STRONG>, it must be 
given a new and distinct name.&nbsp;This allows multiple 
<STRONG>FIGdrivers</STRONG> to exist for the same platform with different 
capabilities.</P>
<P>The format of FIGfonts may not be modified to be 
non-backwards compatible UNLESS:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>
<DIV>The new format is easily editable as an ASCII text 
  file, beginning with the characters "flf" followed by a sequential 
  number.</DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV>At least all of the same information can be derived 
  from the new format as the prior format (currently "flf2").&nbsp;This includes 
  the main comments which give credit to the <STRONG>FIGfont</STRONG> 
  designer.</DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV>Individuals are found who are willing and have the 
  ability to either port or develop versions for at least UNIX, DOS, Windows, 
  and Amiga which will read both the new formats AND the prior format (currently 
  "flf2"), and retain the capability of past versions. It is intended that this 
  will be expanded to include Macintosh if a GUI version exists. This list of 
  required operating systems may be reduced if an operating system falls out of 
  popularity or increased if a new operating system for which there is a 
  <STRONG>FIGdriver</STRONG> comes into greater popularity, according to the 
  consensus of opinions of past developers for the most popular operating 
  systems.</DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV>A C, Java, or other version must always exist which 
  can receive input and instructions either from a command line, a file, or 
  directly over the internet so that <STRONG>FIGures</STRONG> can be obtained 
  from internet-based services without the need to download any 
  <STRONG>FIGdriver</STRONG>.</DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV>All existing <STRONG>FIGfonts</STRONG> available from 
  the "official" point of distribution (<A 
  href="http://www.figlet.org/">http://www.figlet.org/</A>), must be converted 
  to the new format, and offered for download alongsidethe new 
  versions.</DIV></LI></OL>
<H3>The Function of Word Wapping</H3>
<P>All future <STRONG>FIGdrivers</STRONG> should duplicate 
these behaviors, unless a version is only capable of outputting one-line 
<STRONG>FIGures</STRONG>, which is acceptable as long no preceding versions 
exist for its platform which can output multiple-line 
<STRONG>FIGures</STRONG>.</P>
<P><STRONG>FIGdrivers</STRONG> which perform word wrapping do so by watching for 
blanks (spaces) in input text, making sure that the <STRONG>FIGure</STRONG> is 
no more wide than the maximum width allowed.</P>
<P>Input text may also include linebreaks, so that a user may specify where 
lines begin or end instead of relying on the word wrapping of the 
<STRONG>FIGdriver</STRONG>. (Linebreaks are represented by different bytes on 
different platforms, so each FIGdriver must watch for the appropriate linebreaks 
for its particular platform.)</P>
<P>When a <STRONG>FIGdriver</STRONG> word wraps and there are several 
consecutive blanks in input text where the wrapping occured, the 
<STRONG>FIGdriver</STRONG> will disregard all blanks until the next non-blank 
input character is encountered. However, if blanks in input text immediately 
follow a linebreak, or if blanks are the first characters in the input text, the 
blanks will be "printed", moving any visible <STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG> 
which follow on the same output line to the right. Similarly, if an image is 
right-aligned, and blanks immediately precede linebreaks or the end of input 
text, a <STRONG>FIGdriver</STRONG> will move an entire line of output 
<STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG> to the left to make room for the blank 
<STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG> until the left margin is encountered. (If the 
print direction is right-to-left, everything stated in this paragraph is 
reversed.)</P>
<P>Word processing programs or text editors usually behave similarly in all 
regards to word wrapping.</P>
<H3>General Intent for Cross-Platform Portability</H3>
<P>Currently, all versions of <STRONG>FIGlet</STRONG> are compiled from C code, 
while <STRONG>FIGWin 1.0</STRONG> is written in Visual Basic.&nbsp;Over time it 
is intended that a later version of <STRONG>FIGWin</STRONG> will be created 
using a GUI C programming language, and that the <STRONG>FIGlet</STRONG> C code 
shall continue to be written to be easily "plugged in" to a GUI shell.&nbsp;It 
is preferable for developers of <STRONG>FIGdrivers</STRONG> for new platforms to 
use C or a GUI version of C, so that when the core rendering engine of 
<STRONG>FIGlet</STRONG> is updated, it will be portable to other platforms.</P>
<H3>Control File Commands</H3>
<P>New control file commands may be added to later versions of this standard. 
However, the commands "c", "d", and "s" are permanently reserved and may never 
be given a meaning.</P>
<H3>File Compression</H3>
<P><STRONG>FIGfonts</STRONG> (and <STRONG>control files</STRONG>) are often 
quite long, especially if many <STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG> are included, or 
if the <STRONG>FIGcharacters</STRONG> are large. Therefore, some 
<STRONG>FIGdrivers</STRONG> (at present, only <STRONG>FIGlet 2.2</STRONG> or 
later, and <STRONG>FIGlet4Win</STRONG>) allow compressed 
<STRONG>FIGfonts</STRONG> and control files.</P>
<P>The standard for <STRONG>FIG</STRONG> compression is to place the 
<STRONG>FIGfont</STRONG> or <STRONG>control file</STRONG> into a ZIP archive. ZIP 
archives can be created by the proprietary program PKZIP on DOS and Windows 
platforms (modern Windows also have a built-in ZIP archiver) or by the free 
program Info-Zip Zip on almost all platforms. More information on ZIP can be 
obtained at <A href="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/Info-Zip.html">http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/Info-Zip.html</A>.</P>
<P>The ZIP archive must contain only a single file. Any 
files in the archive after the first are ignored by <STRONG>FIGdrivers</STRONG>. In addition, the 
standard extension ".zip" of the archive must be changed to ".flf" or ".flc" as 
appropriate. It does not matter what the name of the file within the 
archive is.</P></body>
